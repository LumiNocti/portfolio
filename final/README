## Project Overview
This project compares different algorithms for solving a simplified version of the **Wumpus World Gridworld Problem**.  
The goal was to design agents that can navigate the world, avoid hazards, and collect the gold.  

Implemented agents include:  
- **Simple Reflex Agent** (`Wumpus_World.py`)  
- **A\* Search Agent** (`A_Star.py`)  
- **Genetic Algorithm Agent** (`GA.py`) *(incomplete at submission)*  
- **Q-Learning Agent** (`RL_Q_Learning.py`)  

To visualize the environment, we included an **Images/** folder with icons used by `pygame`. Make sure it is in the same directory when running any script.

## My Contribution
I (Carlos Santana) primarily developed the **A\* Search Agent**, which:  
- Uses Manhattan distance as a heuristic.  
- Marks tiles as *safe* or *risky* based on percepts (breeze/stench).  
- Assigns penalties (+3) to risky tiles, making the agent risk-aware but not risk-averse.  
- Implements loop-prevention with recent history and backtrack penalties.  
- Converts A\* paths into agent actions (turning, moving, grabbing, shooting).  

This design allowed the A\* agent to balance safety and exploration while avoiding infinite loops.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+ with the following packages:
random
pygame
time
os
collections
typing
enum
IPython
copy
functools
reduce
numpy
matplotlib

## Usage
Run all agents in sequence:
```bash
python Wumpus_Main.py

python A_Star.py          # A* Search Agent
python RL_Q_Learning.py   # Reinforcement Learning Agent
python GA.py              # Genetic Algorithm Agent
python Wumpus_World.py    # Simple Reflex Agent

Results
The A* agent successfully solves boards, prioritizing safe paths and selectively entering risky areas.
Loop guards prevent repeated cycles. The Q-Learning agent improves with training episodes.
GA agent remained incomplete but exploratory code is included.
