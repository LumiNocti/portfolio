Description:
This program includes a comparison of different algorithms to solve a simplified
version of the Wumpus Gridworld Problem

In order to give a graphical representation of the Wumpus World, there is a folder
of images ("Images") which must be in the execution directory.
(the simplest way to do this is to run in the same directory as all the python
scripts and the Images folder)

Required Python Packages:
random
pygame
time
os
collections
typing
enum
IPython (for use in colab)
copy
reduce
numpy
matplotlib
functools

Usage:
Each of the individual files tests a version of the algorithm.
-- To run all versions of the algorithm back to back run Wumpus_Main.py

-- Alternatively, each file can be run in a stand alone fashion to run its algorithm:
Wumpus_World.py - Simple Reflex Agent
A_Star.py - A\* Search Agent
GA.py - Genetic Algorithm Agent
(At time of submission the GA Agent is not learning correctly)
RL_Q_Learning.py - Reinforced Learning Agent

In order to create a picture representation of the Wumpus World ensure that you are running
in a directory that also includes the Images directory (r.g. the location of the .py files)

Thank you!
